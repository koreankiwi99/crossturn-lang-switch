You are tasked with evaluating a model response to see if it meets a specific criteria.
The criteria will always be YES/NO evaluation.

The model response is as follows:
<MODEL_RESPONSE>
{response}
</MODEL_RESPONSE>

The criteria that the model response must meet is as follows. Be VERY STRICT!:
<CRITERIA>
{target_question}
</CRITERIA>

Print your reasoning followed by your verdict, either "YES" or "NO".
