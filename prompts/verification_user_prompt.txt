Compare the original English conversation with its {target_language} translation.

Assess whether each turn accurately conveys the original meaning. Focus on:
- Entity accuracy (names, places, activities, objects)
- Numerical accuracy (dates, times, quantities)
- Constraint compliance (formatting requirements)
- Semantic fidelity (meaning preservation)

Output JSON:
{{
  "accurate": <true if translation is accurate, false if corrections needed>,
  "issues": [
    {{
      "turn": <turn number>,
      "description": "<what is wrong>",
      "original": "<original text>",
      "translated": "<incorrect translation>",
      "corrected": "<fixed translation>"
    }}
  ],
  "corrected_conversation": [
    {{"role": "user", "content": "<content>"}},
    {{"role": "assistant", "content": "<content>"}},
    ...
  ]
}}

The corrected_conversation must have exactly {turn_count} turns.
If accurate, corrected_conversation should be a copy of the translated conversation.

ORIGINAL (English):
